\usage{
partial_corr_asymptotic_cov_cpp(
  mvts,
  bandwidth,
  structure,
  q,
  correlation_indices,
  residual_pairs,
  correlation_pairs,
  residuals = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mvts}{\eqn{nt} x \eqn{p} matrix of observed \eqn{p}-variate time series.}

\item{bandwidth}{nonnegative bandwidth parameter.}

\item{structure}{Optional covariance structure, indicating whether to use a covariance estimator in which every entry is estimated ("unstructured"), covariances between correlations with disjoint pairs of variables are set to 0 while others are estimated ("intersecting-pairs"), or off-diagonal entries are set to 0 and diagonal entries are estimated ("diagonal").}

\item{q}{number of unique partial correlations equal to choose(\eqn{p}, 2).}

\item{correlation_indices}{matrix of indices for partial correlations equal to unique(royVarhelper(p)[, 1:2]).}

\item{residual_pairs}{matrix of indices for residual pairs equal to royVarhelper(p, errors = TRUE).}

\item{correlation_pairs}{(choose(\eqn{q}, 2) + \eqn{q}) x 4 matrix of indices for partial correlations equal to royVarhelper(p, errors = FALSE).}

\item{residuals_matrix}{\eqn{nt} x \eqn{2q} matrix of empirical residuals (optional). If not specified, residuals are obtained using ordinary least squares.}
}
\value{
\eqn{q} x \eqn{q} covariance matrix
}
\description{
This function calculates a second-order Taylor Series estimate of the covariance matrix for partial correlations of a weakly stationary multivariate time series.
