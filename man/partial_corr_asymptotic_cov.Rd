\title{Taylor Series Estimate of Covariance Matrix for Partial Correlations}
\usage{
partial_corr_asymptotic_cov(
  mvts,
  bandwidth = NULL,
  structure = "unstructured",
  residuals = NULL,
  residual_pairs = NULL,
  correlation_pairs = NULL,
  correlation_indices = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mvts}{\eqn{nt} x \eqn{p} matrix of observed \eqn{p}-variate time series.}

\item{bandwidth}{Optional nonnegative bandwidth parameter. If not specified, optimal bandwidth is determined using the method described in Patton, Politis and White (2009).}

\item{structure}{Optional covariance structure, indicating whether to use a covariance estimator in which every entry is estimated ("unstructured"), covariances between correlations with disjoint pairs of variables are set to 0 while all others are estimated ("intersecting-pairs"), or off-diagonal entries are set to 0 and diagonal entries are estimated ("diagonal").}

\item{residuals}{Optional \eqn{nt} x \eqn{2q} matrix of empirical residuals (optional). If not specified, residuals are obtained using ordinary least squares.}

\item{residual_pairs}{Optional (choose(\eqn{q}, 2) + \eqn{q}) x 4 matrix of indices for residual pairs equal to royVarhelper(p, errors = TRUE).}

\item{correlation_pairs}{Optional (choose(\eqn{q}, 2) + \eqn{q}) x 4 matrix of indices for partial correlation pairs equal to royVarhelper(p, errors = FALSE).}

\item{correlation_indices}{Optional matrix of indices for partial correlations equal to unique(royVarhelper(p)[, 1:2]).}

\description{
This function calculates the second-order Taylor Series estimate of the covariance matrix for partial correlations of a weakly stationary multivariate time series proposed by DiLernia, Fiecas, and Zhang (2024).
